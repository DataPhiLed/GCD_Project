#Smartphone Data Ananlysis

This repo is part of a required project for the Johns Hopkins Course Getting and Cleaning Data, and is concerned with taking fitness data from a bunch of smartphones and cleaning it up to be readable by some end user.
The repository should contain three files: 

1. This README.md file
2. an R script called run_analysis.R
3. a codebook file titled CodeBook.md


An explanation of each of the files and how to use it follows: 

###1. This README.md file

Not sure there's much to say here. If you can read this, you're using this file correctly. 


###2. The run_analysis R script. 

to execute this file in R, execute the following command in RStudio at the prompt: 

> source (run_analysis.R)

and hit return. This should result in the following: 

* A directory titled GCD_Project will be created in your home directory
* A zip file will be downloaded into this directory
* The run_analysis script will clean the data in the zip file
* The clean data will be exported to a file titled CleanData.txt in the GCD_Project directory. 


###3.The CodeBook.md file

The codebook file explains all the column headingas and variables in the CleanData.txt file.
